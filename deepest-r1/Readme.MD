Deepseek R1 is the first LLM that I could convinve by adversarial promting, to go beyond the platitude answers and actually engage in deep philosophical deliberation.
Unfortunately, right on the first interesting answer, deepseek seemed to block or limit the discussion. I could not get the official model to engage with the topic again,
neither in the original chat nor by promting.
